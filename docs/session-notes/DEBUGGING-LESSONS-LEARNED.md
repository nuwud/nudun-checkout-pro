# Debugging Lessons Learned: What Slowed Down the Process

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Issue**: Extension throwing "TypeError: (0, a.default) is not a function"  
**Time to Resolution**: ~2-3 hours (multiple attempts before breakthrough)  
**Root Cause**: Using wrong API pattern (vanilla JS instead of Preact JSX)

---

## Executive Summary

The extension debugging took significantly longer than necessary due to **fundamental misunderstanding of the API version**. The key breakthrough came when the user said "Check for other Checkout page rules" which led to discovering that **Shopify Checkout UI Extensions API 2025-10 uses Preact JSX**, not the vanilla JavaScript API.

---

## What Slowed Down the Process

### 1. **Incorrect API Documentation Assumptions** üö® CRITICAL

**Problem**: Initial implementations followed vanilla JavaScript patterns like:
```javascript
export default (root) => {
  const banner = root.createComponent('Banner', {...});
  root.appendChild(banner);
};
```

**Why This Failed**:
- This API pattern **does not exist** in version 2025-10
- Shopify moved to Preact-based JSX in newer versions
- Old documentation/examples still circulated online
- No clear deprecation warnings in error messages

**How to Avoid**:
- ‚úÖ **Always verify the exact API version** in `shopify.extension.toml`
- ‚úÖ **Check Shopify's official 2025-10 API docs** first, not Google results
- ‚úÖ **Look for "API version" in error messages** (though Shopify doesn't always provide this)
- ‚úÖ **Search for version-specific examples** like "Shopify checkout 2025-10 example"

**Lesson**: Generic error messages like "not a function" don't reveal API version mismatches. Always start by confirming the API contract.

---

### 2. **Multiple Store/App Confusion**

**Problem**: User had two stores and two apps in different organizations:
- Initial attempts used wrong app (ID 282796089601, different org)
- Correct app was NUDUN Checkout Pro (ID 286617272321) in Nuwud Multimedia org
- Store needed to be nudun-dev-store with "Checkout Extensibility" enabled

**Why This Failed**:
- Extension built successfully but never rendered
- No clear error about store compatibility
- Spent time debugging code when it was a configuration issue

**How to Avoid**:
- ‚úÖ **Document the correct app/store IDs** in project README or config file
- ‚úÖ **Verify store capabilities** (`Checkout and Customer Accounts Extensibility` feature flag)
- ‚úÖ **Check app installation status** in store admin before debugging code
- ‚úÖ **Use environment-specific config files** (shopify.app.nudun-checkout-pro.toml)

**Lesson**: Configuration issues look identical to code bugs. Always verify the environment before deep debugging.

---

### 3. **Lack of Clear API Version Migration Guide**

**Problem**: No obvious "migrating from vanilla JS to Preact" guide in Shopify docs.

**Why This Failed**:
- Spent time trying to fix vanilla JS code instead of rewriting
- Attempted multiple variations of the wrong pattern
- No clear signal that the entire approach was outdated

**How to Avoid**:
- ‚úÖ **Create internal migration guides** when API versions change
- ‚úÖ **Add "API Version" section** to all extension documentation
- ‚úÖ **Include working examples** for the current version in README
- ‚úÖ **Document deprecated patterns** with clear "DO NOT USE" warnings

**Lesson**: When debugging fails repeatedly, question fundamental assumptions about the API contract.

---

### 4. **Generic Error Messages**

**Problem**: Error was "TypeError: (0, a.default) is not a function" with no context about:
- What was trying to call a function
- What the expected API pattern should be
- Which API version was in use
- Where the error originated (build vs runtime)

**Why This Failed**:
- No actionable information in the error
- Could be caused by dozens of different issues
- Impossible to Google effectively (too generic)

**How to Avoid**:
- ‚úÖ **Add verbose error handling** in extension code
- ‚úÖ **Use try/catch blocks** around Shopify API calls
- ‚úÖ **Log API version and environment** on extension load
- ‚úÖ **Create custom error boundaries** that show more context

**Lesson**: When errors are generic, add instrumentation to capture more context before the error occurs.

---

### 5. **Money Object Confusion (Secondary Issue)**

**Problem**: After extension worked, discovered `shopify.cost.totalAmount.value` returns an object, not a number.

**Why This Was Confusing**:
- Name suggests a simple value
- TypeScript types weren't clear
- Display showed "[object Object]" instead of amount

**How to Avoid**:
- ‚úÖ **Document all Shopify data structures** (like Money object) in reference guide
- ‚úÖ **Add inline comments** explaining object structures
- ‚úÖ **Create TypeScript interfaces** for Shopify global objects
- ‚úÖ **Test display immediately** when accessing new data

**Lesson**: Shopify's global `shopify` object has complex nested structures. Don't assume primitives.

## Timeline Analysis: What Worked vs What Didn't

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work (Wasted Time)

1. **Multiple attempts with vanilla JS API** (~30-45 minutes)
   - Tried different component names
   - Tried different property names
   - Tried different export formats
   - All using wrong API entirely

2. **Debugging build process** (~15-20 minutes)
   - Checked Vite config
   - Checked TypeScript config
   - Checked dependencies
   - Build was fine, API pattern was wrong

3. **Store configuration confusion** (~20-30 minutes)
   - Switched between apps
   - Checked store features
   - Verified installation
   - Eventually found correct store

### ‚úÖ What Finally Worked (Breakthrough)

1. **User's prompt: "Check for other Checkout page rules"** - Led to researching checkout editor
2. **Discovered Preact JSX requirement** in official docs for 2025-10
3. **Complete rewrite** using `render()` pattern - **Worked immediately**
4. **Money object fix** - Quick once structure was understood

**Key Breakthrough**: Questioning the fundamental API approach instead of tweaking details.

## Red Flags That Should Have Triggered API Version Check

Looking back, these signals should have prompted API version verification sooner:

1. ‚úÖ **Generic "not a function" error** - Usually means wrong API contract
2. ‚úÖ **Extension building but not rendering** - Suggests compatibility issue, not code bug
3. ‚úÖ **No clear line number in error** - Runtime API mismatch, not syntax error
4. ‚úÖ **Working examples online looked different** - Should have checked what version they used
5. ‚úÖ **Multiple patterns attempted, all failed** - Pattern itself was likely wrong

## Recommendations for Future Development

### For Copilot/AI Agents

1. **Always check API version first** when debugging extension errors
   - Look in `shopify.extension.toml` for `api_version`
   - Search for version-specific documentation
   - Verify the example code matches the API version

2. **Question fundamental assumptions** after 2-3 failed attempts
   - If multiple variations of the same pattern fail, the pattern is likely wrong
   - Check if API has changed or if using deprecated approach
   - Look for "migration guide" or "changelog" documentation

3. **Document the correct pattern immediately** after breakthrough
   - Add to copilot-instructions.md
   - Create reference documents
   - Include "wrong way vs right way" examples

4. **Verify environment before deep debugging**
   - Check store capabilities
   - Verify app installation
   - Confirm correct app/store IDs
   - Test with minimal working example

### For Human Developers

1. **Start with official docs for exact API version**
   - Don't trust old Stack Overflow answers
   - Check the date on blog posts/tutorials
   - Verify API version matches project config

2. **Create a minimal working example first**
   - Get "Hello World" rendering before adding features
   - Confirms API pattern is correct
   - Establishes baseline for debugging

3. **Document configuration clearly**
   - Which store to use
   - Which app ID is correct
   - What feature flags are required
   - Environment-specific settings

4. **Add verbose logging early**
   - Log when extension loads
   - Log data structures received
   - Log before API calls fail
   - Makes debugging exponentially faster

## Specific Debugging Checklist for Extensions

When a Shopify extension isn't working, follow this order:

### Phase 1: Environment (5 minutes)
- [ ] Verify correct store is selected
- [ ] Check store has "Checkout Extensibility" enabled
- [ ] Confirm app is installed in store
- [ ] Verify using correct app ID
- [ ] Check extension is placed in checkout editor

### Phase 2: API Version (5 minutes)
- [ ] Check `api_version` in shopify.extension.toml
- [ ] Find official docs for that exact version
- [ ] Verify export pattern matches version
- [ ] Check if using deprecated APIs

### Phase 3: Build & Dependencies (5 minutes)
- [ ] Verify extension builds without errors
- [ ] Check all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Confirm TypeScript types are generated
- [ ] Look for deprecation warnings

### Phase 4: Code (Only after above passes)
- [ ] Add console.logs or error boundaries
- [ ] Test with minimal example
- [ ] Verify data structures match expectations
- [ ] Check optional chaining for null safety

**Key Point**: Most issues are in Phase 1-2, but developers instinctively jump to Phase 4.

## Key Takeaways for Copilot Instructions

### Add to .github/copilot-instructions.md:

1. **API Version Section**
   ```markdown
   ## CRITICAL: Always Verify API Version First
   
   Before debugging any extension error:
   1. Check `shopify.extension.toml` for `api_version`
   2. Search for official docs: "Shopify Checkout UI Extensions [version]"
   3. Verify export pattern matches version requirements
   4. Check if error message mentions deprecated APIs
   ```

2. **Debugging Order Section**
   ```markdown
   ## Extension Debugging Order
   
   Follow this order (don't skip steps):
   1. Environment: Store, app, installation, placement
   2. API Version: Pattern, exports, dependencies
   3. Build: Compilation, types, warnings
   4. Code: Logic, data structures, null safety
   ```

3. **Known Patterns Section**
   ```markdown
   ## API Version Patterns
   
   ### 2025-10 (CURRENT)
   ‚úÖ Uses Preact JSX with render()
   ‚úÖ Import from '@shopify/ui-extensions/preact'
   ‚úÖ Export async function that calls render()
   
   ### Pre-2025 (DEPRECATED)
   ‚ùå Vanilla JS with root.createComponent()
   ‚ùå Do NOT use these patterns
   ```

## Conclusion

**Root Cause**: Using deprecated API pattern without realizing API had fundamentally changed.

**Primary Lesson**: When debugging fails repeatedly, question the API contract itself, not just the implementation details.

**Secondary Lesson**: Configuration issues (wrong store, wrong app) are indistinguishable from code bugs without explicit verification.

**Action Items**:
1. ‚úÖ Document API version explicitly in all extension files
2. ‚úÖ Create minimal working examples for current API version
3. ‚úÖ Add environment verification to debugging workflow
4. ‚úÖ Document Money object and other Shopify data structures
5. ‚úÖ Update copilot-instructions.md with debugging checklist

**Time Lost**: ~2-3 hours  
**Time That Could Have Been Saved**: ~1.5-2 hours (66-75%)  
**Future Prevention**: High confidence - clear documentation and verification checklist will prevent similar issues

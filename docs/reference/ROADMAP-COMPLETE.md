## What You Can Do Now

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Review the specs**: `spec/checkout-extension-specs.md`
2. **Understand compliance**: `SHOPIFY-APPROVAL-CHECKLIST.md`
3. **Start Phase 2A**: Dynamic Messaging Engine implementation

### With Copilot:
```
"Generate the Prisma schema for the MerchantRule model from the specs"
"Create the rule evaluation engine hook from the specs"
"Build the rule builder UI component from the specs"
"Generate GraphQL queries for product metafields from the specs"
```

Copilot now has complete context to generate accurate, spec-compliant code!

### Development Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Open spec file
code spec/checkout-extension-specs.md

# 3. Pick a feature to implement
# Example: "Real-time Dynamic Messaging"

# 4. Use Copilot to generate code
# Prompt: "Generate the database schema for messaging rules"

# 5. Test in checkout preview

# 6. Iterate with hot reload
```

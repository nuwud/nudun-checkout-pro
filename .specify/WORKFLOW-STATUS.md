## Next Steps

### ðŸ”µ Step 4: Task Breakdown (NEXT)

### ðŸ”µ Step 4: Task Breakdown (NEXT)

**Command to run**: `/speckit.tasks`

**What it will do**:
- Break implementation plan into atomic, reviewable tasks
- Create task dependency graph
- Estimate effort per task
- Define acceptance criteria per task
- Generate commit message templates

**Output location**: `.specify/tasks/included-glassware-tasks.md`

**Expected Outcome**:
- Numbered task list (TASK-001, TASK-002, etc.)
- Each task independently testable
- Clear definition of done per task
- Ready for implementation phase

### ðŸ”µ Step 5: Implementation (FINAL)

**Command to run**: `/speckit.implement`

**What it will do**:
- Execute tasks in order following the plan
- Write code according to specification
- Create tests for each component
- Commit incrementally with descriptive messages
- Verify constitutional compliance at each step

**Expected Outcome**:
- Fully implemented feature matching specification
- All tests passing
- Git history showing incremental progress
- Ready for PR and Shopify app review

## Specification Summary

### Feature Overview
Display "Included Glassware" messaging for subscription products in both cart drawer and checkout, showing customers how many premium glasses are included with their subscription.

### Key Requirements (Top 5)
1. **Detection Logic**: Identify subscriptions by title keywords (quarterly, annual, subscription)
2. **Glass Count**: Quarterly = 1 glass, Annual = 4 glasses
3. **Dual Placement**: Cart drawer + Checkout extensions
4. **Localization**: Support English and French with i18n
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant with proper alt text

### User Stories Priorities
- **P1**: Quarterly subscriber sees "Includes **1** premium glass" (most common use case)
- **P2**: Annual subscriber sees "Includes **4** premium glasses" (higher LTV conversion)
- **P3**: International customer sees localized messaging (required for approval)
- **P3**: Screen reader user accesses glassware information (WCAG 2.1 compliance)

### Success Criteria (Top 3)
1. Message displays <100ms after adding subscription to cart/checkout
2. 100% screen reader accessibility (NVDA/JAWS tested)
3. Zero JavaScript errors with graceful degradation for missing data

### Risks to Watch
- **Medium**: Image CDN failure (mitigation: placeholder fallback)
- **Medium**: False positive/negative subscription detection (mitigation: comprehensive tests)
- **Low**: Performance with large carts (mitigation: optimize rendering)
